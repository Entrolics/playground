# playground
playground repo to learn git for the people who are new to git.

To Start off,

set up git user name and email which will be used to identify the person making contributions to the products.Run following commands in the terminal(Linux & MacOS).

`git config --global user.email "your email"`

`git config --global user.name  "your name"`
Clone the playground repo.

`git clone https://github.com/Entrolics/playground.git`
Now, you're set up to start playing and learn git.

Following are the most commonly used git commands and I would recommend you start from there.

   `git clone`

   `git branch`

   `git checkout`

   `git pull`

   `git push`

   `git fetch`

   `git add`

   `git commit`

   `git merge`

   `git status`

   `git diff`

   `git log`
These commands are enough for now to get you started with git through terminal. Once you feel comfortable using git through terminal, you can use gui applications such as gitk and git gui. "gitk" provides visual representation of 'git log' and 'git diff' and "git gui" let's you do everything else.

Following links will help you learn all these commands.
